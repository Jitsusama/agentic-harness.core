/**
 * Running a command with nobody at the keyboard.
 *
 * A host's own exec is built for a person watching: the child shares the
 * host's terminal, so when git wants a password or ssh a passphrase it
 * opens that terminal and waits. Inside pi the terminal belongs to pi's
 * interface, so the prompt is drawn over it, the keys never reach it, and
 * the tool that ran git waits forever with nothing the person can press.
 * Closing stdin does not help, since a prompt opens the terminal itself.
 *
 * So the child leads a session of its own, which leaves it no terminal to
 * open, reads end of input from stdin, is told by git's and gh's own
 * variables not to ask, and is stopped along with everything it started
 * when its signal fires or its clock runs out. Signing through an agent
 * or a helper still works, since neither needs a terminal: every commit
 * made through pi's own bash tool, which runs the same way, is signed.
