/**
 * The record's rules for a single write, applied before it lands.
 *
 * A write is refused only when the rule it breaks is certain from the
 * path alone, and every refusal says where the write belongs instead, so
 * the refusal is a redirection rather than a dead end. What a path cannot
 * decide (an attachment's size, whether it is text, whether a document
 * cites it) is left to the check on disk after the write.
 *
 * The rules hold in every quest's folder, not only the loaded quest's,
 * since a write into another quest's record breaks that record just the
 * same.
