/**
 * Guardian-side glue for the prose gate. Detects prose
 * violations in a body, asks the pure decision what to do, and
 * persists a new signature when it blocks. The decision logic
 * lives in the prose and gate modules; this is only the
 * read/persist wiring against a caller-supplied signature store.
 *
 * The signature store itself (`GateDeps`) is deliberately not
 * implemented here: reading and persisting a "have I blocked this
 * before" signature means something different per adapter (pi
 * keeps it in its session log; a stateless CLI would keep it in
 * its own state file). Each adapter supplies its own `GateDeps`.
