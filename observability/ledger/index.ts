/**
 * The ledger: a store of billable turns, and what one is.
 *
 * Cost is derived from the logs a harness already writes rather than
 * recorded a second time, so there is exactly one writer of the truth
 * and the ledger can be rebuilt from scratch whenever its shape
 * changes.
 *
 * Reading those logs is not here. A turn is a portable idea; the format
 * it was written in is not, so each harness parses its own and hands
 * over records. This module knows what a turn is and where to keep it.
