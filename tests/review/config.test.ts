/**
 * What a repo mapping is allowed to say.
 *
 * A mapping used to pin a provider and nothing else, so the reader
 * only had to decide whether it named one. It can now also say where
 * a repo is checked out, which is the one fact nothing else on the
 * machine can supply, and that turns two lenient readings into real
 * faults: a match is a substring test, so an empty one claims every
 * repo there is, and a path is handed to git, so a relative one is
 * resolved against whatever directory the session happens to be in.
 *
 * Both fail a long way from here and read as "that is not a checkout
 * of this repo", which is a true sentence about the wrong problem.
