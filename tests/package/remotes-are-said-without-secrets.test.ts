/**
 * A remote URL reaches a person with no credential in it.
 *
 * A remote that authenticates inline carries the token in the URL, and git
 * accepts it as either the user or the password. So a message that names the
 * remote verbatim prints a live secret into the transcript, into whatever log
 * keeps it, and into whatever the person reading it pastes somewhere else.
 * That is not hypothetical: a refusal about the wrong repo did exactly this,
 * which is why the gate exists.
 *
 * The check is coarse, because a string is only a leak once someone reads it,
 * and nothing static knows that. It asks a narrower question with a reliable
 * answer: is a remote being interpolated into a message without going through
 * the one function that makes one safe to say. Passing is not proof of no
 * leak. Failing is very nearly proof of one.
 *
 * Ported from agentic-harness.pi's own gate, which watched `lib/` and
 * `extensions/`; the one site it was written against, a work provider's
 * refusal naming an unregistered repo's remote, moved here along with
 * `lib/work`. Scoped to `review` and `work`, the two domains that ever
 * carry a `remoteUrl` into a message.
