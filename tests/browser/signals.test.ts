/**
 * What the warm browser does when this process is signalled.
 *
 * Chrome must not outlive the process, so a signal kills it. But the
 * process belongs to its host: pi saves its session and restores the
 * terminal on SIGTERM and SIGHUP, and a library that answers the same
 * signal with `process.exit` ends the process before the host's handler
 * has run. Puppeteer's own handlers did exactly that, and so did ours.
