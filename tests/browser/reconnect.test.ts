/**
 * A second, separate connection to the one warm browser.
 *
 * connectShared() exists for a caller that is not the process that
 * launched Chrome: a stateless-per-invocation CLI has no processGlobal
 * state to find getBrowser()'s singleton in, so it needs a different way
 * in — the DevTools WebSocket endpoint the launching process published
 * to disk. This is a real-Chrome test rather than a unit test because
 * the thing being proven is that Chrome actually accepts a second,
 * independent DevTools connection over the port while the launching
 * process is still holding its own connection over the pipe, which is
 * not something a mock can stand in for.
