/**
 * A second session taking and giving up its share of one tree.

 * Run as its own process by the custody test, because the fault it
 * looks for is two processes rewriting one record: inside one process
 * each rewrite runs to its end before another starts.
 *
 * Arguments: the memory directory, the held tree as JSON, how many
 * times to take and give up a share, and a file to wait for before
 * starting, so every child starts together.
