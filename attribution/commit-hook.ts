/**
 * The prepare-commit-msg hook that attributes every commit made
 * under an adapter, not just a typed `git commit`. Command-level
 * injection only sees a literal git commit; cherry-pick, revert,
 * rebase, merge and editor commits reach attribution only through
 * this hook.
 *
 * The trigger condition (an env var pi can set before its own tool
 * call, a marker file a Claude Code hook can only write to disk,
 * ...) is the one thing that genuinely differs per adapter, so it's
 * the one thing this module takes as a parameter rather than
 * assuming. Everything else — idempotent install, chaining any
 * hook the repo already had, never adding a second AI co-author —
 * is host-agnostic and shared.
